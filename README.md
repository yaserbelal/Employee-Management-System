# Employee-Management-System

A comprehensive web-based application for user management and database interaction.

This project was developed as part of the GDG On Campus Zagazig Tasks. It utilizes PHP for server-side scripting and integrates with a MySQL database, showcasing core principles of web development,
including form handling, data validation, and CRUD operations. Through this project,
we gained practical experience in backend development, database design, and secure data processing â€” essential skills in full-stack web development.
